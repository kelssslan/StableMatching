# StableMatching
This is a **optional** project I did in Algorithm Design and Analysis course. 

This program was created and tested using Python 3 on Google's colab platform. 


**The program can be run using terminal.
Navigate to the folder where the .py file is located
open the .py file**

The user inputs two integers in the format (n k ). Where n is the number of students and hospitals and k is number of possible rankings.
 
**Note:** When the user inputs one integer, the program sets n = k. 

**Clarification:**  
Each index corresponds to a hospital, so index 0 refers to Hospital 0's preference list. 
And inside Hospital 0's preference list [4, 2, 0, 1, 3] shows that Hospital 0 prefers Student 4 over all students.
